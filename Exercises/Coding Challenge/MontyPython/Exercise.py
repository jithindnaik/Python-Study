# Programming Challenge: Monty Python
# In a .py file, create a program and use input() three times to get answers to the following questions from a user.  Store each of the answers in a variable.

# What is your name?

# What is your quest?

# What is your favorite color?

# Then, concatenate everything into a string within a print() statement with the form "So your name is [name], your quest is [quest], and your favorite color is [color]."

name = input("What is your name?")
question = input("What is your quest?")
fav_color = input("What is your favourite color?")
print("So your name is " + name +", your quest is "+ question +", and your favorite color is "+ fav_color +".")
